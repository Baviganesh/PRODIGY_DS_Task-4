Analyzing & Visualizing Sentiment Patterns in Social Media

The purpose of this research is to use recurrent neural networks with long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to do sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. Based on their textual content, the goal is to categorize movie reviews as either good or negative.The outcome of this project will be a model that can accurately classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments, which can be used to classify new movie reviews in the future.

The IMDB dataset is a widely used dataset for sentiment analysis, particularly for text classification tasks. It contains a collection of 50,000 movie reviews, which are labeled as positive or negative based on their sentiment. Each set contains an equal number of positive and negative reviews. The reviews were collected from the IMDb website, a popular movie and TV show review site. The reviews are stored in text format and are relatively long, typically containing multiple sentences. The dataset contains a mix of reviews for different types of movies, including action, drama, comedy, and horror.
